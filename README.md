# Audio-Classification-Model
Feeding a .wav file type and converting it to MFCC file further and assigning the audio to particular person
Conducted exploratory analysis using K-means clustering to identify similarities across clusters(better insights)
Designed and trained a Sequential Neural Network for audio classification by utilizing key audio MFCC features
